# GAME-OFF-2018-Team-Project
This is where my team for this event will upload ideas, files, and graphics for the game so we can submit when the event ends.

Game name: Tentative

Story: A merchant somehow walks into a spirit world and tries to find out why she's there. Classic RPG gameplay, stealth and lots of humor ensue.
